# Ecosystem simulator

Below is a simulation of a simple ecosystem.

<pre id="ecosystem"></pre>

It contains the following:

  - **@** are predators
  - **H** are herbivores
  - **\*** are plants

Everything is fighting for survival. The predators hunt the herbivores, and
the herbivores eat the plants. Watch how the herbivores form herds and run to
escape the predators. Everything reproduces and creates more of itself, given
enough time. Refresh the page to see it happen again. It's different every
time.

If you watch long enough, you'll notice there's one big problem with this
world - it's completely unbalanced. Often within 5 minutes, all but one
species gets wiped out, and that's no fun, nor is it realistic.

That's where you come in. Read [the guide](guide) to learn
how you can create a balanced ecosystem by editing simple text files.

The fate of this virtual world is in your hands!
